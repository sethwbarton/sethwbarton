## Hi! I'm Seth

- 📝 I write on substack.sethwbarton.com
- 👷‍♂️ I'm working on becoming a consistent contributor to open source. 
- 🚅 I'm currently learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
- ♨️ I'm currently working with React, TypeScript, and Spring Boot

When I'm not developing software, I like to spend time with my wife and kid, exercise, and read classic fiction. Sometimes I enjoy a good video game.


I'm an alumni of Brigham Young University with a B.S. in Computer Science. I know most people get out of college thinking it was a waste of time, but BYU actually educated me at a reasonable price, and for that I bleed blue.


Currently working at Ford Motor Company as a Software Engineering team lead. My job history looks like BYU student developer -> junior dev at a startup -> mid-level dev at a startup -> senior dev at a consulting firm -> Ford.


The open source repos you see on my profile mostly act as a history of my learnings and adventures in new tech up to this point.
